MAZE:
The dimensions are 101cm x 101cm x 3cm.
There are total 121 structures in number
Dimensions of each structure is 1cm x 1cm x 10cm.
The Horizontal and Vertical walls will need to be generated with respect to the position of the Base, hence they should be made child of Base when generated.


The functions generateHorizontalWalls() and generateVerticalWalls() are called in sysCall_beforeSimulation() in the given customization script. This way, all the walls are generated in the scene before the simulation starts.

deleteWalls() function is called in sysCall_afterSimulation() in the given customization script. This way, all the walls present in the scene are deleted after the simulation ends.

In Lua
Instantiating objects:sim.createPureShape,sim.setObjectPosition,sim.setObjectParent,sim.setObjectOrientation 
Deleting Objects:sim.removeObject
Change Color:sim.setShapeColor


Rotating and transforming Object:
sim.setObjectOrientation()(sim.setObjectOrientation(wallObjectHandle, -1,{0,0,math.pi/2})),
sim.setObjectPosition(sim.setObjectPosition(wallObjectHandle,-1{0,0,0.05})),
sim.setObjectQuaternion,sim.setObjectMatrix
CHange Name of object: sim.setObjectName(sim.setObjectName(wallObjectHandle,"Wall1x2")),
Making object Parent : sim.setObjectParent()(sim.setObjectParent(wallObjectHandle,sim.getObjectHandle("script"),true))
#Vision Sensor Image:simxGetVisionSensorImage,simVisionSensorHandle
